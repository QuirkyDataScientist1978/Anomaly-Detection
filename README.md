# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection methods

# Preprocessing
* Trajectory matrix/ Rolling window representation of time series data.

# Algorithms
* LSTM Autoencoder

# Datasets
* [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark](https://github.com/numenta/NAB)
    * machine_temperature_system_failure.csv: Temperature sensor data of an internal component of a large, industrial machine. The first anomaly is a planned shutdown of the machine. The second anomaly is difficult to detect and directly led to the third anomaly, a catastrophic failure of the machine.
